# About me

ðŸ¤  G'Day! I'm an educated software developer looking for professional experience in the IT industry. I pursue new knowledge with curiosity, and I learn best when I am creating something. I love making programs, drawing cartoons, walking and camping in the bush and enjoy movies, games and conversations with my friends. On this website, you can use or read about some of my past and current projects that I've built in my own time or during my time at the University of Wollongong.

# Projects
## University of Wollongong
### AIIA
#### HTML, JS, CSS, JIRA, Python.

The Artificial Intelligence for Issue Analytics (AIIA) plugin for Atlassian JIRA was my favourite experience at University. For the subject CSIT321 and supervised by Dr. Hoa Dam, I worked with entusiastic and coordinated team mates to produce a product which we were all proud of. The project involved predicting issue attributes based off the issue name and description using machine learning. I was responsible for creating a data visualisation to show relationships between issues in a JIRA project. We won third place at the School of Computing and Information Sciences Tradeshow (2019). You can find a link below which talks about the project's features in more detail.
> "Through this   project, he   has   been   enthusiastic,   motivated   and   hard-working. He has demonstrated  good  problem  solving  abilities.  He  was  able  to  comprehend  new concepts  and  problems  that  he  had  not  learned  or  been  familiar  with  before  and  came  up  with  innovative  solutions for them."

### MATTER
#### HTML, JS, CSS.

The Metamorphic Automatic Testing Tool for Evaluating Restful Web APIs (MATTER) was the CSCI318 Group project developed by myself and designed and documented with Tim Piert, Luke Dimovski and Arvind Thillainathan. Based off of research by Dr. ZhiQuan Zhou, the program uses [_metamorphic testing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_testing) to determine whether the actual outputs from a RESTful web API match the expected results. This was a challenging project as I had to learn about an unfamiliar testing technique and apply it to a real-world system.

### Roly Poly
#### Unity Engine, C#.

Roly Poly is a racing game made with unity for the CSCI365 group project, where a player can customise their a ball and then race it against other balls on a track. This project was challenging as we had to brainstorm an initial concept and design the game from the ground up. Try it out by clicking the link!

### Drop Bear
#### Autodesk Maya.

For the CSCI236 group project, we were required to make an advertisement using 3D animation. We decided to make a satirical ad about Drop Bear repellent. As group leader, I identified tasks, estimated their completion time and assigned tasks to team members according to their skills and preferences. I expressed my ideas so that everyone knew what I was envisioning, and actively encouraged team members to put forth their own ideas and constructive criticisms. This was a fun class which allowed me to be creative and practice my leadership skills. You can see the drop bear model and conceptual sketches that I made here:

## Self-Initiated
### Cabin Horror
#### Unity Engine, C#.

The Cabin Horror is a basic game concept that I came up with where one must rob graves to find supplies and defend their cabin, however the more graves you rob, the more monsters begin hunting you! It is still in it's early stages of development. Try it out by clicking the link!

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
