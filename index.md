# About me

ðŸ¤  G'Day! I'm an educated software developer looking for professional experience in the IT industry. I pursue new knowledge with curiosity, and I learn best when I am creating something. I love making programs, drawing cartoons, walking and camping in the bush and enjoy movies, games and conversations with my friends. On this website, you can use or read about some of my past and current projects that I've built in my own time or during my time at the University of Wollongong.

# My Projects

### AIIA
#### University of Wollongong - CSIT321. HTML, JS, CSS, JIRA, Python.

The Artificial Intelligence for Issue Analytics (AIIA) plugin for Atlassian JIRA was my favourite experience at University. Supervised by Dr. Hoa Dam, I worked with entusiastic and coordinated team mates to produce a product which we were all proud of. The project involved predicting issue attributes based off the issue name and description using machine learning. I was responsible for creating a data visualisation to show relationships between issues in a JIRA project. We won third place at the School of Computing and Information Sciences Tradeshow (2019). You can find a link below which talks about the project's features in more detail.

### MATTER
#### University of Wollongong - CSCI318 Group Project. HTML, JS, CSS.

The Metamorphic Automatic Testing Tool for Evaluating Restful Web APIs (MATTER) was a project developed by myself and designed and documented with Tim Piert, Luke Dimovski and Arvind Thillainathan. Based off of research by Dr. ZhiQuan Zhou, the program uses [_metamorphic testing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_testing) to determine whether the actual outputs from a RESTful web API match the expected results. This was a challenging project as I had to learn about an unfamiliar testing technique and apply it to a real-world system.

### Cabin Horror
#### Self-Initiated. Unity Engine, C#.

The Cabin Horror is a basic game concept that I came up with where one must rob graves to find supplies and defend their cabin, however the more graves you rob, the more monsters begin hunting you! It is still in it's early stages of development. Try it out by clicking the link!

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
