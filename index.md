# About me

ðŸ¤  G'Day! I'm an educated software developer looking for professional experience in the IT industry. I pursue new knowledge with curiosity, and I learn best when I am creating something with what I've learnt. On this website, you can use or read about some of my past and current projects that I built in my own time or during my time at the University of Wollongong.

# My Projects

## MATTER
### University of Wollongong, CSCI318 Group Project
The Metamorphic Automatic Testing Tool for Evaluating Restful Web APIs, or MATTER for short, was a project developed by myself and designed and documented with Tim Piert, Luke Dimovski and Arvind Thillainathan. Based off of research by Dr. ZhiQuan Zhou, the program uses [_metamorphic testing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_testing) to determine whether the actual outputs from a RESTful web API match the expected results. This was a challenging project as I had to learn about an unfamiliar testing technique and apply it to a real-world system.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
